# plotpvalue
Performs ANOVA or T-test among the groups within the categories and plots horizontal line for significant pair. It will put * for p < 0.05, ** p< 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.

# Description
If you have a box or bar plots (python seaborn) with x, y, and hue value. You can use this module to perform the ANOVA or independent T-test on the hue for each x value. If you choose ANOVA, first the code will check if the all the means and if any category is ANOVA significant (p <0.05), it will perform the Tukey post-hoc test on that category. You can get the p-values as a dataframe or you can plot horizontal line to indicate significance of the pair.

# Workthrough
Required packages
```py
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind, f_oneway
from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd
from itertools import combinations
```
Import the module

```py
import plotpvalue
```

```py
get_pvalues(df, x_col, y_col, hue_col, hue_order=None)
```
Uses independent T-test to get the p-values and return it as a dataframe
df = dataframe
x_col = x column of the box and bar
y_col = y axis of the box and bar
hue_col = hue of the plot
hue_order = optional.

```py
get_pvalues_anova(df, x_col, y_col, hue_col)
```
Performs ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post-hoc test on the hue for each x value.

```py
add_pvalue_annotations(df, x_col, y_col, hue_col, ax, hue_order=None, method='ttest')
```
Adds significance bars to an existing plot, with a choice of statistical method.

# Remark
Code was significantly generated by Google Gemini over my idea and tweaking.
